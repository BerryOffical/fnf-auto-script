# fnf-auto-script
My very bad bot for playing Friday Night Funkin'. But whatever, it can still play the game better then me.

## Usage
- use python 3
- install all prerequisite libraries (through pip)
- start the game (through executable, browser version not supported)
- have the game window in the default position (only 1080p screens are supported)
- press enter in the python console to start the script
- once the script detected grey on the right position, it will not stop until you press 'q' while the 'camera' window is clicked on
